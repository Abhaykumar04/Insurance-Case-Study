# Data Exploratory Analysis and Hypothesis Testing for Insurance Claims Data

#### This project involved conducting a data exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing on the claims_data.csv and cust_data.csv datasets in order to gain insights into insurance claims data. The goal of the analysis was to answer specific research questions and hypotheses related to the data.

### Introduction

#### The project began with an introduction that provided some background on the dataset and the research questions we were hoping to answer through our analysis. We also discussed the data cleaning and preparation steps we took to ensure that our data was ready for analysis.


### Data Exploratory Analysis

#### We used a variety of data exploratory analysis techniques to gain a better understanding of the data, including summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis. We were able to uncover several interesting insights, including:

•The most common types of insurance claims

•The average claim amount for each type of insurance claim

•The distribution of claim amounts across different age groups

•The correlation between claim amounts and policy premiums


### Hypothesis Testing

#### We also conducted hypothesis testing to test specific research questions or hypotheses. We used statistical tests such as t-tests and ANOVA to analyze the data, and we were able to find several significant results, including:

• A significant difference in claim amounts between male and female policyholders

• A significant difference in claim amounts between different age groups

• A significant difference in claim amounts between policyholders with different types of insurance coverage


## Conclusion

#### Overall, this project provided valuable insights into insurance claims data and demonstrated the usefulness of data exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing in gaining insights from data. We discussed the implications of our findings and provided suggestions for future research or analysis that could be done with this dataset.
